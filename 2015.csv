I went through this exam (rather quickly, I should say), so I am expecting a few mistakes. With that being said, here are the answers I achieved if you would like to discuss:

1
(a) v= 25i + 25j, a = -25j
(b) v(dot) = -17.68
(c) ρ = 40.82

2
(a) ωBC = (vC)/(5L)
(b) αAB = (-vC^2)/(15L^2)
(c) αBC = (4vC^2)/(75L^2)

3
A. 2(sA^2 + 4)^(1/2) + sB = L

For 1(a), I got a = -625j. Probably did the differentiation differently, this answer seems a bit absurd until you realize it's in cm, but I think the math is right. (xdotdot=0, y**= -xdot^2 is what I got)
That changes the rest, 1(b) -441.23
( c) rho = 2.82

2(a) I got a -Vc
(b) alphaAB=(-Vc)^2/(25L^2sin(theta))
( c) 4(Vc^2)/(125L^2sin(theta))

I figured for 3d that the angular velocities would be the same.

It is also important to recognize in the problem, r double dot would represent the rate of change in the change of radius size or the acceleration of the radius and since the car is on a fixed track, the track will not be expanding. Likewise, theta double dot would represent the rate of change of the change in theta which we will later come to recognize as angular acceleration and so you shouldn't worry about that in this problem. If you don't have your book yet and are not sure which coordinate system, watch the Chapter 1, Section A videos.","1","","325","648","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1421119419.4914910793304443359375;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""rmccorm"";}","","","341","hansen50","41@purdue.edu","","173.15.46.89","2015-01-13 10:20:49","2015-01-13 15:20:49","For the acceleration vector, do they just want the e-sub-t and e-sub-n arrows drawn on the diagram?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lets first get ydot:

ydot = d/dt(x^2/2-10x)

(chain rule)

ydot = (x - 10)xdot

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have ydot, lets find y double dot, which I have put here as ""y2dot"" :

y2dot = d/dt (xdot(x-10)) &gt;&gt;&gt; this is the time derivative of the y component of the velocity you already found (ydot)

(product rule -- and a little chain rule to get xdot^2)

y2dot = x2dot(x-10) + xdot^2

r(t) = x[i] + y[j]
v(t) = xdot[i] + ydot[j]
a(t) = x2dot[i] + y2dot[j]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


So first step is finding xdot:

We were told the expression for ydot in the problem statement, but we need ydot in terms of xdot so we can find xdot 

ydot = d/dt(x^2/2-10x)

(chain rule)

ydot = (x - 10)xdot

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have xdot, lets find x double dot, which I have put here as ""x2dot"" :

However, if you're using the traditional coordinate frame (toward the top of the page is positive j, toward the right of the page is positive i), then both the i and j term should be negative. Since this is all about relative motion, you can imagine the observation car (car B) to be standing still, and imagine that car A is doing all the moving. In this case, it would appear as though car A is accelerating both away from your observation point (in the negative i direction) and downward toward the center of its circular path (in the negative j direction at this instant). Now for signs. For example, the fact that the j component of acceleration has any magnitude means that acceleration is happening parallel to the ""j"" direction, with the sign indicating in which direction the acceleration is happening. ""Deceleration"" simply means that the acceleration vector is in the opposite direction of the velocity vector, meaning that a positive acceleration quantity could still cause deceleration (if velocity is negative).","1","","0","731","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1421976338.9936110973358154296875;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:8:""matthew8"";}","","","495","dodihi","109@purdue.edu","","24.15.46.209","2015-01-22 22:26:36","2015-01-23 03:26:36","Hey guys from the example in class, shouldn't your v(dot) component be in the j direction?

a_top=a_a[i]-rw^2[j]
a_bot=0[i]+rw^2[j]

Does that make sense to anyone else?","1","","573","605","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1422500254.708053112030029296875;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""tczekaj"";}","","","579","Rebekah","60@purdue.edu","","128.211.219.108","2015-01-28 22:35:23","2015-01-29 03:35:23","Anyone get Vb=5i-5j ft/s and Ab= -10i+10j ft/s^2?","1","","0","648","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1422502523.61347103118896484375;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""rmccorm"";}","","","581","uthakur","131@purdue.edu","","128.211.190.174","2015-01-28 23:04:36","2015-01-29 04:04:36","The acceleration of the no slip point you mentioned is R*(omega)^2 towards the center of the disk.

We cross multiplied the w(ab)^2L term when we are just supposed to multiply the scalar of w(ab)^2 to the position vector of L.

So instead of w(ab)^2[K]xL[i]=w(ab)^2L[j], it should be w(ab)^2L[i].

The particle is in contact with the surface of the slot, which causes a frictional force that opposes the direction of motion (we know that the motion is in the tangential direction).

Therefore, there is a force (""change in momentum"") in the tangential direction.  Since momentum is mass*velocity, a change in momentum is mass*acceleration.

So, what we just said is that there is a mass*acceleration in the tangential direction.  Mass is just a scalar multiple, so from a motion perspective, we just note the acceleration in the tangential direction.","1","","1083","645","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1424844493.216106891632080078125;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""kremer1"";}","",""

Here we go...

Summing the forces on m_A, assuming static friction (not moving) in the UPHILL direction:

ΣF_x = 0 = T - (friction) - weight * sin(Ɵ) 
ΣF_y = 0 = N_A - weight * cos(Ɵ)

N_A = weight * cos(Ɵ)
weight = m_A * g
friction = u_k * N_A



Plugging it all in:

T = u_k * m_A * g * cos(Ɵ)  +  m_A * g * sin(Ɵ)

where T now represents the maximum tension before the block will start slipping. Basically, if the tension is smaller, it will not move.

When you plug in the givens, T = 21.086 N. 

T when the blocks are released from rest = m_B * g = 19.62 N

T is not great enough to overcome static friction in the uphill direction.








Summing the forces on m_A, assuming static friction (not moving) with impending motion in the UPHILL direction:

ΣF_x = 0 = T + (friction) - weight * sin(Ɵ) 
ΣF_y = 0 = N_A - weight * cos(Ɵ)

N_A = weight * cos(Ɵ)
weight = m_A * g
friction = u_k * N_A


Plugging it all in:

T = - u_k * m_A * g * cos(Ɵ)  +  m_A * g * sin(Ɵ)

where T now represents the minimum tension before the block starts slipping. Basically, if the tension is larger, it will not move.

plugging in the givens, T = 8.343 N.

T when the blocks are released from rest = m_B * g = 19.62 N

Tension in the cable is too high to allow the block to slide down the slope. 



THEREFORE, BECAUSE THE TENSION IS TOO HIGH TO KEEP BLOCK A FROM SLIPPING DOWN THE HILL AND TOO LOW TO PULL BLOCK A UP THE HILL, THE BLOCKS WILL REMAIN STATIC WHEN RELEASED FROM REST. 

THE TENSION WILL BE EQUAL TO 19.62 N.

BOTH ACCELERATIONS WILL BE EQUAL TO ZERO.","1","","0","629","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1424748134.82207489013671875;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""abernar"";}","","","1064","Dwight Shrute","95@purdue.edu","","10.184.130.20","2015-02-23 22:24:55","2015-02-24 03:24:55","Oops, please change UPHILL to ""DOWNHILL"" in the 14th line.","1","","0","629","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1424748295.592670917510986328125;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""abernar"";}","","","1065","Dwight Shrute","95@purdue.edu","","10.184.130.20","2015-02-23 22:47:22","2015-02-24 03:47:22","Oops, please change UPHILL to ""DOWNHILL"" in the 14th line.

Also, what I am doing is calculating the necessary T (a max and a min) for the block to start moving in either direction. 

Then I compare that to the actual value for T, which is equal to the weight of block B downward when the two blocks are in static equilibrium (which is an adequate assumption since the problem states they start at rest).

For a real world example, Mose and I often have difficulty getting the spring harvest of beets to the hopper, due to their vines pulling them the other way.

What I did was solve this first as a kinematics problem with (a_p/o)_rel left as a variable. You know it will be in the y direction because it is traveling in a straight line relative to the moving reference frame (observer standing on the horizontal bar). Therefore, you get your net acceleration with an unknown (a_p/o)_rel. You equate f in the y direction to the acceleration term with a_rel in it after you solve for the normal force using the known acceleration in the x direction. 

You cannot assume that velocity relative is constant, so you have to leave acceleration relative in your computations. 

Don't be scared by unbalanced forces. In statics they were bad because we couldn't balance it to zero, but in dynamics we use them as a source of acceleration, be that in the direction of motion (these cause a change in speed) or perpendicular to velocity (these cause a change in direction).

This acceleration however is only the (a_po)rel term since the point of contact applying the force is itself moving. You have to then plug that into the overall equation getting a_p=-50.4i-4.2j-15.12 --&gt; a_p=-50.4i-19.32j.

I was getting that same answer however I found my mistake. 

First of all an easy way to check yourself is at the end see if the amount of energy matches what you started with. So lets do that. You start with a 20 kg block dropping a height of (.4 - (-.3)) meters, which means there is 137.34 joules of potential energy in the system at time zero. Since it starts at rest, all kinetic energy at the end must equal 137.34 at the end. 

If your block A is moving at 3.7 m/s, this means your block B is moving at around 2.77 m/s, and that means there is approximately 174.45 joules of kinetic energy. This can't be true, so we need to go back and fix our equation. 

Now, when you solve it all out, you come down to the very last step and you gotta plug in for v_b to solve, there's a term that you forgot to give a negative exponent to. The (.5^2 - .3^2) term should be (.5^2 - .3^2)^-1.","1","","1159","629","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1425242052.55208110809326171875;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""abernar"";}","","","1180","vanderpo","71@purdue.edu","","69.174.155.42","2015-03-01 16:24:18","2015-03-01 21:24:18","why is it to ^-1?","1","","1178","684","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1425245058.9821979999542236328125;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:8:""vanderpo"";}","","","1184","Ser Arthur Dayne","165@purdue.edu","","128.211.192.240","2015-03-01 19:39:18","2015-03-02 00:39:18","Isint the solution kind of on the course packet front cover?

I believe because the force F is not completely tangential to the object's motion, then F * r cannot be the work expression for the non-conservative term.

Rather, if you split the force into it's tangential and normal components by defining an e_r and e_theta coordinate system and taking the force as:

Fcos45 * e_theta + Fsin45 * e_r

then I think you could dot this force with a ds vector quantity of e_theta * ds under your integral.  

This integral would become the integral from pi/2 to pi of Fcos45 * r * d_theta with r * d_theta being ds.

Differentiated this. 
Put in the values at for positions 1 and 2... to get the corresponding values / equations for velocities.

Also
delta(s_b) + sqrt(h^2 + delta(s_a)^2) = 0
This is not differentation but only a small time interval.
This gives a value that can be used for work energy equation's Potential Energy terms.

v_A2 = 8.012 m/s

v_B2 = 4.807 m/s


PROOF OF CORRECTNESS (not the way to solve but a justification): 

This works because you start with 250 J of Kinetic energy (block B is not moving). You loose 49.05 J of gravitational potential energy because block b (10kg) moves up against gravity by 0.5 m. The system then gets 75 J of work done on it by the force F through 1.5 m. This comes to 275.95 J of Kinetic energy that should be present in the end.

If you look at the kinetic energy at the end, there is .5 * 5 * 8.012 ^2 + .5 * 10 * 4.807 ^ 2 = 276.016 J of kinetic energy present at time 2.

1. It is an external force.

3. Tension is internal
4. W_a and N do not have point of application moving thus have no work. What about W_b?


If your thinking: Since W_b is counteracted by tension, why don't we consider the tension counteract applicable on the force F????

Essentially, we are analyzing the effects that forces have on the momentum of the blocks.  The integral you solve (which you do, in fact, use dt) gives us the ""sum of the (Force) * (each infinitely small change in time)"".  This value gives us the ""total change in momentum over time Δt"".

After time Δt, the force no longer acts on the block.  Another way of saying this is that after time Δt, the momentum doesn't change any more at all.  Knowing that there are no forces acting on the block after time Δt, the momentum (and thus, the velocity) will be constant for all times beyond Δt.","1","","1284","645","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1425531380.7469160556793212890625;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""kremer1"";}","","","1296","rasmussk","84@purdue.edu","","74.45.113.188","2015-03-05 20:19:02","2015-03-06 01:19:02","Adding on to Coach, if you think about it in terms of the equation, you would take the integral first from time 0 to time delta_t + the integral from time delta_t to time t_2 (since t_2 &gt; delta_t). since the force after time delta_t is zero, the integral of zero is still zero and therefore the specific time t_2 doesn't matter so long as it is greater than delta_t","1","","1284","703","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1425604742.766397953033447265625;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:8:""rasmussk"";}","","","1297","Ron Swanson","48@purdue.edu","","128.211.188.187","2015-03-05 21:03:08","2015-03-06 02:03:08","I got the same since no forces act on it after the impulse.","1","","1267","647","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1425607388.9452190399169921875;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:8:""gschuler"";}","","","1303","jordan65","82@purdue.edu","","10.184.18.251","2015-03-05 23:33:48","2015-03-06 04:33:48","So do you leave it as a whole system or split it into a system for each pellet?","1","","0","673","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1425616428.8282759189605712890625;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:8:""jordan65"";}","","","1306","neal27","23@purdue.edu","","128.211.196.160","2015-03-06 01:28:20","2015-03-06 06:28:20","Look at each pellet individually.

When you take the angular momentum equation you have the integral of the moments about pt E equals the angular momentum of position 2 minus angular momentum of position 1. In the book (pg 250) it defines Mo=r(p/o) CROSS R where R is the moment about O. If the moment is the force crossed with the direction towards O (or here E), then with the force always being towards the planet, our moment would be 0 which is the whole reason that you can set HE2=HE1. The reason this doesn't work with what curry16 is saying is because if gravity was in a constant direction (e.g. always in the positive i direction) then your integral of your moment with respect to time would not be equal to zero and then you would still have to take that into account even if m canceled out (like if you use the gravitational force ellapang uses).

When you analyze just ""a"" at the begining it has an agular velocity, which is kenetic energy in one direction. When you analyze ""a"" at the end it still has an angular velocity which you can think about as kenetic energy in one direction. But now it's also sliding on the bar. So now it also has a linear kenetic energy in a perpendicular direction to the angular velocity. So you have to take in to account both directions. I think the way they teach it in the book is that they break up the velocities in the e_theta and e_r directions. Let me know if you are still confused.","1","","1462","694","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1427209471.0097548961639404296875;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""millanm"";}","","","1465","Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick","186@purdue.edu","","10.184.211.31","2015-03-24 18:02:29","2015-03-24 22:02:29","Move the equations over and simply. but yes i got 6.25 and 4.26","1","","0","816","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1427234549.2915689945220947265625;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:6:""kgasik"";}","","","1471","Coach Kent Murphy","50@purdue.edu","","10.184.10.142","2015-03-25 00:58:23","2015-03-25 04:58:23","Thank you muchly, 420blazin.","1","","1463","645","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1427259503.64849090576171875;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""kremer1"";}","","","1644","Captain Jack Sparrow","95@purdue.edu","","75.150.199.105","2015-04-01 19:51:28","2015-04-01 23:51:28",".NNM..                                    8NM7.

1. Get the x-dir and y-dir Force equations where the accelerations are a_G_x and a_G_y respectively.
2. Get the Moment equation about G!! as A is not a fixed point, center of mass, or acceleration parallel to G. The three moments about G are from the normal force, and the x and y components of P.
3. Use kinematics to relate a_G_x to alpha. Using omega = 0 and the fact that a_A is only in the y dir, my relationship was a_G_x = alpha*h/2

But I think my answer makes sense

Looking just at point A
      The acceleration would be  zero in the x-dir and                                 .     P * sin(theta) / m     in the y-dir
     so a(A) = ( 0 i +  (P * sin(theta) / m ) j ) m/s^2

Moving on..

Summing the Moments about A gives us
      I(A) * alpha + r(G/A) X (m *a(A))  =                                  
      P*sin(theta)*b + P *cos(theta)*h

This allows us to get rid of the normal force acting at A

The last step is to find I(A) which is defined on pg 305
I(A) = I(G) + md(AG)^2
and I(G) = 1/12 * m * (b^2 + h^2)


plugging in I(G) to find I(A) using d(AG)^2 = 2.5 
 I(A) = 1666.667
then plug the a(A) we found and I(A) into 
     I(A) * alpha + r(G/A) X (m *a(A))  =                                  
      P*sin(theta)*b + P *cos(theta)*h
       (copied  from above) 

and solve for alpha

I used r(G/A) = (-2i 1.5 j) 

I got alpha  = 2.88 m/s^2","1","","0","779","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1427397000.7077009677886962890625;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:8:""obrien63"";}","","","1516","obrien63","10@purdue.edu","","72.12.194.58","2015-03-26 15:14:26","2015-03-26 19:14:26","Sorry wrong units I meant 2.88 rad/s^2","1","","0","779","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1427397266.6995189189910888671875;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:8:""obrien63"";}","","","1517","Captain Jack Sparrow","95@purdue.edu","","75.150.199.105","2015-03-26 16:43:59","2015-03-26 20:43:59","d(AG)^2 = 6.25 because d(AG) = sqrt( (b/2)^2 + (h/2)^2 ), meaning that d(AG)^2 = (b/2)^2 + (h/2)^2, which is 6.25","1","","1515","629","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1427402639.4684009552001953125;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""abernar"";}","","","1518","ajax","169@purdue.edu","","72.12.205.35","2015-03-26 16:53:20","2015-03-26 20:53:20","The Newton equation here only refers to point G.

First I got 3.57 something. Same as Cdaman and Tony Stark.

This was when I accounted for the change in potential energy with change in kinetic

Kinetic includes translational and rotational..... but heres the deal

kinetic_rot = 0.5*Iw^2 and w is substituted with its respective formula so as to relate it to the velocity of g.

this formula though contains a distance term that most people take as the distance from O (that gives you 3.57) but the question is, is that the centre of rotation.

the distance there needs to be from the centre of rotation which will be at the point of contact. 

Using this i got v to be 1.19m/s (reinforcing our good ol pirate)

the second decimal is probably off because of some intermediate calculation.

I have not plugged in my values till the end though....


Good luck people.. hope this helps","1","","1648","810","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1428042323.5463159084320068359375;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:8:""sbadamik"";}","",""

I feel that after abandoning ship last night, I need to redeem myself as per the rules of the pirate's code and specifically of parlay, even though they're more like guidelines anyway.

Some of you may be stuck with figuring out U_1&gt;2. I think I've found a solution to the logic that clears up some other dynamics issues I've been having concerning rolling circles.

Our coordinate axes will be parallel and perpendicular to the incline, for simplicity.

Ok so let's call the contact point C, the center O and the point where the cable last touches the disk A. C is stationary due to no slip surface. Let's call the displacement of the cable x, and the displacement of the disk d.

U_1&gt;2 is integral( F dot ). That's not new, but this is the first time we have to calculate x. We know d so let's just use that to relate to x. Ok so since v_c = 0, v_a = omega * R/2, while v_b = omega * 3/4R.

Now we need to figure out how this relates to d. O IS THE ONLY POINT ON THE DISK WHICH NEVER HAS DISPLACEMENT IN THE Y DIRECTION. IT IS THE ONLY POINT WHOSE DISTANCE FROM THE INCLINE REMAINS CONSTANT. This means the time integral of the velocity of O is going to be the horizontal displacement of the disk, which we have called d.

Alright, so we have already done enough to relate v_O to v_A. v_A =  3/2 * v_O.

When a point  travels at, say, 3/2 times the velocity of another point, the distance it covers will also be 3/2 times the distance of the first point(I REALLY HOPE THATS RIGHT IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE BECAUSE THE INTEGRAL ONLY MULTIPLIES A SCALAR TIME TERM).

I would hope you can take it from here, me hearties.","1","","0","629","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1428096843.240830898284912109375;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""abernar"";}","","","1686","Captain Jack Sparrow","95@purdue.edu","","166.175.56.60","2015-04-03 17:36:18","2015-04-03 21:36:18","Well gosh I meant to put 3 not 3/2 because I messed up and put the distance from A to C as 3/4R rather than the correct 3/2R.","1","","1685","629","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1428096978.3098199367523193359375;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""abernar"";}","","","1687","kylewanteggroll","14@purdue.edu","","128.211.245.20","2015-04-03 19:29:18","2015-04-03 23:29:18","I have (Delta)s_B = 3(delta)s_O to conclude that U = 3Fd

The weight is conservative. The tension force (which we assume is constant), acts upward on the block and to the right on the disk. This provides a non-conservative force on both objects. 

If you make the block and the disk your system, this non-conservative force becomes internal to the system, and the only external forces are conservative (gravity and spring). 

I did it both ways, and you get the same final equation in both cases.

If the inner section has an arc length distance of 2 meters, then the outer part will travel 4 meters along the fixed surface, making x equal to 4 meters.

However, I must be honest, there are a few huge mistakes people are making here.

First of all, you should really make your system about C whenever possible so you only have to use one equation.

Second of all, FRICTION FORCE DOES NOT SWITCH DIRECTIONS. Think about it: the angular momentum of the disk is constantly decreasing, and becomes negative at the top of the trajectory. The only force that exerts a moment about the center of the disk to change angular momentum is friction. It needs to DECREASE the absolute value of the angular momentum before the top of the trajectory, and then INCREASE the absolute value of angular momentum after it turns around. In order to do that, the direction of the friction needs to be up the slope in both cases. It needs to be up while it moves upslope to slow it down, and up on the downslope to speed it up.","1","","0","629","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1428459146.7486660480499267578125;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""abernar"";}","","","1774","jordan65","82@purdue.edu","","10.184.222.147","2015-04-07 22:22:25","2015-04-08 02:22:25","Correction, 9.24i m/s","1","","1763","673","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1428459745.8823568820953369140625;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:8:""jordan65"";}","","","1775","ecarrow","55@purdue.edu","","72.12.194.2","2015-04-07 22:30:36","2015-04-08 02:30:36","The friction force does nothing to affect the translational momentum of the disc.

If you take the disk as your reference frame, the earth turns around it, and the force of friction is no different than any other force. It does affect translational momentum because some of the gravitational force that would have contributed to the translational momentum is instead used to rotate the disk. 

Friction cannot be ignored. Otherwise, we would have a smooth surface. It is because of the no-slip condition that friction causes the rotation of the disk. The disk is rotating at the beginning and it is also rotating at the end. It stops at the top, but the magnitude of the angular acceleration does not change, which causes the frictional force to continue applying in the uphill direction. 

It all depends what point you sum your moments about. Do not do work-energy on this problem because it will get you confused. Work energy is for distance related problems. here we're looking at time based problems.","1","","1773","629","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1428461100.249228954315185546875;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""abernar"";}","","","1777","Captain Jack Sparrow","95@purdue.edu","","75.150.198.65","2015-04-07 23:05:03","2015-04-08 03:05:03","I got 9.2 actually. #oops","1","","1727","629","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1428462303.58520793914794921875;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""abernar"";}","","","1778","mahaus","144@purdue.edu","","72.12.194.134","2015-04-07 23:21:58","2015-04-08 03:21:58","Thinking about this conceptually, how is it possible to find V_2 if we do not know the coefficient of friction?

However, I think you may need to re-examine your equation for tension. My guess is you got T = -2m*x_dbldot + 2mg.

The way I did it, this would multiply T by a ""-2R"" factor when summing moments about the contact point. 

Regardless, you wind up with 3/2*m*x_dbldot from your mass moment of inertia, and then 4*m*x_dbldot from your tension force. This gets you 11/2, or 5.5.

However, you need to back up to your Tension force calculations. Tension DOES NOT HAVE AN X_DBLDLOT TERM IN IT UNLESS YOU CONVERT THE LINEAR ACCELERATION OF THE BLOCK TO THE LINEAR ACCELERATION OF THE DISK.

The center of the disk is moving with an acceleration of x_dbl_dot, while the block is moving with an acceleration equal to the horizontal acceleration of the point where the cable attaches to the disk. There is a factor of 2 in there, making the answer:

9.5x_dbldot + kx + -4mg

You're usually stuck either saying every variable is a magnitude and the direction is shown on the diagram, or drawing every force as positive and solving for the sense (+/-) with the equations.
The senses get all messed up now that we have oscillation (the signs of displacement, acceleration, and velocity are not always the same, and not even always the same relative to one another -- sometimes you have positive displacement with negative acceleration, and sometimes you have negative displacement negative acceleration, etc).

Therefore, I find it easiest to draw everything AS IT WOULD BE FOR A POSITIVE AXIS. 

.
.
 
1. Spring Force:
Spring force will always oppose displacement. You can draw the sense of that on your diagrams OPPOSITE of whatever direction the positive axis is from there (positive x = negative force).

.
.
2. dashpot forces
these will always oppose velocity, so will also be in the direction opposite a positive axis (positive xdot = negative force)

.
.
3. moments, angular acc, angular velocity
I draw these so that they are referenced going in the positive z direction (counter clockwise) I let the math handle the signs
.
. 
4. Friction
This becomes so confusing when you get into the general case for the full oscillation that you can DRAW IT ANY WAY YOU WANT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO SUM THE MOMENTS ABOUT THAT POINT ANYWAY SO THAT YOU DON'T GET CONFUSED","1","","1854","629","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1428981564.6729929447174072265625;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""abernar"";}","","","1858","hdeshpan","135@purdue.edu","","10.186.107.19","2015-04-13 23:49:23","2015-04-14 03:49:23","Same, not sure what happened to the mass in Captain Jack's equation.","1","","1856","758","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1428983363.0700790882110595703125;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:8:""hdeshpan"";}","","","1859","Andrew","8@purdue.edu","","128.46.194.135","2015-04-14 09:33:49","2015-04-14 13:33:49","I ended up getting the (11/2)mx(double dot)+kx-4mg=0 as well.

(FBD for disk), kx is a spring force that goes to the right and Tension Force is going down, this equals to Io*Ø_doubledot. Second, for the fbd of the block, Tension will go up and force 2mg will go down, I made this equal to 2mÿ. After analyzing FBDs i did the summation of moments abour point O. This gave me equation one which is TR-KxR=Io*Ø_doubledot.Then, i did summation of forces in the direction i determined as y (EFy=2mÿ). By doing this I got equation 2, 2mg-T=2mÿ. My kinematics ended up being y=RØ_doubledot(3) and x=RØ(4).My raw answer was 2mgR-2mR^2Ø_doubledot-KR^2Ø=Io*Ø_doubledot. Io being 1/2mR^2. After simplifying. I got the same answer as the captain.

The frictional force imparted on the block due to the wheel when the block is accelerating in the positive x direction will be negative, and such the frictional force on the wheel when the block is accelerating will be positive. 

With this in mind, I found (5*m/2)theta_dbl_dot + (3*k)theta

However, upon further examination, regardless of whether or not frictional forces are opposing or in the same direction, the same EOM emerges:

7mx_dbldot + kx = f(t)

This is convenient because it confirms a suspicion of mine that a system behaves according to THE SAME HOMOGENEOUS EQUATION OF MOTION REGARDLESS OF DRIVING FORCE. 

The amplitude of x_p (which we call the amplitude of the forced response) is given on page 411 of the book. However, if you solved your EOM in terms of X, setting X to be the displacement of the spring from its unstretched length, you will have to take 1/2 the amplitude of x because C only moves half the distance of the two balls.","1","","0","629","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1430088222.7789199352264404296875;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""abernar"";}","","","2014","Captain Jack Sparrow","95@purdue.edu","","75.150.199.105","2015-04-26 18:44:26","2015-04-26 22:44:26","0.0166667/2 = .00833333

We begin with the fact that friction exists mainly and only due to its tendency to oppose motion.

Now in this situation, the driving force should cause a certain type of motion in B, the friction from both C and ground would attempt to oppose this.

The reaction would in turn create a motion in C that would be further opposed by A and a force opposing linear motion created by another force is generally in a direction opposite to the causing force.

So our new friction would be opposite to the original.

However, if the force acts on A itself, all these directions would be changed for the frictions and I am guessing we should have a different equation of motion.

C5.1 - b - Solving out and substituting, mass and radius don't show up in final equations.

C5.2 - a - (answered above)

C5.3 - G is straight down because there are no forces acting in the x-direction to cause it to move left or right.

C5.4 - c - There's no acceleration, so friction = 0

C5.5 - b - Draw FBD, and since alpha is clockwise, the forces in D are greater than forces at C

C5.6 - top right car - since it is rear-wheel drive, there is an applied torque on the back wheel. Friction will oppose that motion. The front wheel doesn't have an applied torque, so friction opposes the acceleration.

C5.7 - b &amp; c - D is fixed, G is center of mass, and neither O or E are COM, fixed, or have accelerations parallel to r. So you can't use the special forms of Euler's equation.

C5.8 - e - A is not COM or fixed, so b gets cancelled out. a and c just have problems with the letters not matching up in the equations.","1","","0","695","akismet_result","false","","akismet_history","a:4:{s:4:""time"";d:1429473592.0228579044342041015625;s:7:""message"";s:28:""Akismet cleared this comment"";s:5:""event"";s:9:""check-ham"";s:4:""user"";s:7:""richeyr"";}","","","1945","Mechanics Man","12@purdue.edu","","10.184.66.228","2015-04-19 16:14:14","2015-04-19 20:14:14","C5.9 - c - acceleration of g is always pointing in the direction of the center.
